Changes in 3ac code:
    changed way of procedure call - used predefined registers
    changed way of returning value - used predefined registers
    rbp -> %rbp
    stackptr -> %rsp
    offset starts from positive value (not 0 i.e. includes cur var size)

Note - final output is stored in out.s (currently checking on test_1.java)

Completed:
- prologue
- return instruction with value
- OPERATORS:
    - assignment
    - add/subtract (unary as well)
    - CHECK: multiply/divide
    - shift (<< / >>), bitwise and (&), or (|), xor (^)
- CONTROL FLOW:
    - label
    - unconditional jump
    - TODO: conditional jump
- TODO: function call
- TODO: register allocation
